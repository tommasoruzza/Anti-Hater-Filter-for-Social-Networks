# Anti-Hater-Filter-for-Social-Networks

I worked on a Deep Learning based “Anti-Hate Filter” system to automatically moderate user comments on a tech forum. The goal was to detect multiple types of toxic content (threats, insults, obscene language, identity-hate etc.) and classify each comment into one or more toxicity labels, improving safety and quality of online discussions.
